			<p>There are many reasons to love a dog. Dogs are loyal
				companions that bond with their master and stay loyal to him to his
				death. Seldom do we see such dedication from any living beings.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris)is a
				subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus), a member of the Canidae
				family of the mammalian order Carnivora. The term "domestic dog" is
				generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog
				was the first domesticated animal[4] and has been the most widely
				kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human history.</p>

			<p>Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf
				ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body
				language.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>These sophisticated forms of social cognition and
				communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and
				ability to fit into human households and social situations, and
				these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has
				enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the
				planet today.</p>

			<h2>Wolf is my parent!</h2>
			<p>It is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as such
				to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or whether dog's
				evolutionary path had already taken a different course prior to
				domestication.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For example, it is hypothesized that some wolves gathered
				around the campsites of paleolithic camps to scavenge refuse, and
				associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored those who
				were less frightened by, and keener in approaching, humans.</p>

			<p>DNA studies have provided a wide range of possible divergence
				dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago, to as much as 100,000 to
				140,000 years ago. These results depend on a number of assumptions.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Genetic studies are based on comparisons of genetic diversity
				between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some estimates of
				divergence dates from DNA evidence use an estimated wolfcoyote
				divergence date of roughly 700,000 years ago as a calibration.</p>
